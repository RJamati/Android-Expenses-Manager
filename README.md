# Android-Expenses-Manager

This repo contains the code for this Expense Manager, built using Android Studio.

This project demonstrates the use of MVC design patterns, Android database connectivity, and third party pie chart library.

The app allows the user to create a local account. Once logged in, the user enters their monthly income, they will then need to enter their expenses. The user can also create different categories for their expenses or income.

Once the user has entered their monthly incomings and expenses, the app will present a pie chart to represent the data.
